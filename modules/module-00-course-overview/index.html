          <h2>1. Remembering: Tools, Definitions, and Setup 🧠</h2>

          <p>
            This course is built on the industry-leading open-source Observability stack. We focus on tools provided by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
          </p>

          <h3 class="tech-name-heading">Prometheus 📈</h3>
          <p>
            The primary time-series database and metric collection engine. It uses a pull model to scrape metrics from targets at regular intervals.
          </p>

          <h3 class="tech-name-heading">Loki 💾</h3>
          <p>
            The logging component, designed to be cost-effective and highly scalable. Unlike ElasticSearch, Loki indexes only metadata (labels), not the full log text, making querying and storage extremely efficient.
          </p>

          <h3 class="tech-name-heading">Grafana 🖥️</h3>
          <p>
            The visualization layer. Grafana acts as the powerful front-end, connecting to both Prometheus and Loki to build integrated, actionable dashboards for all telemetry data.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="tech-name-heading">OpenTelemetry (OTel) 🔗</h3>
          <p>
            The instrumentation standard. OTel provides the APIs, SDKs, and collectors to generate and manage metrics, logs, and traces in a standardized, vendor-neutral way.
          </p>
          
          <hr/>
          
          <h3 class="subheading">Prerequisites</h3>
          <p>
            To successfully complete the hands-on labs in this course, you must have the following software installed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>VS Code / Code Editor: For editing HTML, CSS, and configuration files.</li>
            <li>Docker and Docker Compose: Crucial for running our entire observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki) locally with a single command.</li>
            <li>Basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Git: For managing the course project code.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Understanding: Context and Course Flow 💡</h2>

          <h3 class="subheading">The Modern Web Problem</h3>
          <p>
            In the past, web applications were monolithic and predictable. Today, they are distributed across microservices, containers (like Docker), and serverless functions. When a user experiences an error, pinpointing the source across dozens of interdependent services becomes nearly impossible using traditional monitoring alone.
          </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">History and Context</h3>
          <p>
            Observability as a concept originated in Control Theory and was popularized in the software world by teams at Google, Twitter, and Netflix. It is defined as the measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from its external outputs. For software, this means instrumenting the code to generate data (telemetry) that allows us to ask any question about the system *post-facto*.
          </p>
          
          <blockquote class="standout-opinion">
            Monitoring asks: "Is the system working?" (Predefined questions).
            Observability asks: "Why is the system not working?" (Unforeseen questions).
          </blockquote>

          <h3 class="subheading">Benefits and Challenges</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Benefits: Faster Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR), greater confidence in deploying code, and a deeper understanding of user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Challenges: Requires initial code instrumentation, can generate massive amounts of data (cost management), and requires shifting the engineering mindset from reactive to proactive.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <hr/>
          
          <h3 class="subheading">Course Flow</h3>
          <p>
            The course is structured to follow the life cycle of telemetry data:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Foundations (M0-M1): Defining observability and telemetry concepts.</li>
            <li>Collection & Storage (M2-M3): Focus on instrumentation and getting data into the backend systems (Prometheus, Loki).</li>
            <li>Visualization & Action (M4-M5): Building dashboards in Grafana and setting up alerting.</li>
            <li>Project (M6): Applying all concepts to a real-world, end-to-end web application.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>6. Creating: Future Potential and New Solutions 🚀</h2>

          <p>
            The field of observability is constantly evolving. After mastering this stack, you will be prepared for several advanced directions:
          </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Expanding Data Collection</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Evolving OpenTelemetry: OTel is rapidly becoming the single standard for instrumentation. Future work involves extending OTel to more languages and advanced data correlation features.</li>
            <li>Cloud Integration: Migrating the local Docker stack to managed services like AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or Google Cloud Operations (all of which integrate with the technologies learned here).</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 class="subheading">Advanced Analytics</h3>
          <p>
            Beyond simple alerting, the next step involves using Machine Learning to automatically detect anomalies and predict system failures based on the metric data you are now collecting. The principles of time-series analysis you learn here are the foundation for these advanced systems.
