                Brief History of Web Analytics & Observability
              </h3>
              <p>
                It is helpful to comprehend the origins of the current
                observability stack and how it relates to the past of web
                analytics in order to provide context for these results.
              </p>

              <h4 class="subheading">
                From Log Files to Web Analytics Platforms
              </h4>
              <p>
                Teams used raw web server logs to analyze traffic in the early
                days of the internet (mid-1990s). Access logs from Apache or
                Nginx were parsed by programs like simple log analyzers, which
                then reported hits, referrers, and user agents. The focus
                shifted to marketing funnels, sessions, and conversion events
                around 2005 when JavaScript-based, client-side analytics like
                Google Analytics became popular. Rather than the performance of
                the underlying systems, the focus of this era was on
                <strong>who</strong> is using the site and how they behave.
              </p>

              <h4 class="subheading">The Need for Observability</h4>
              <p>
                Simple dashboard counters and uptime checks were insufficient as
                architectures moved toward microservices, containers, and
                distributed systems. After failures, engineering teams needed to
                be able to ask fresh, unexpected questions about production
                systems. This led to the emergence of observability, which
                involves not only monitoring a few predetermined metrics but
                also producing rich telemetry (metrics, logs, and traces) that
                reveals the internal workings of intricate systems.

                Prometheus: Metrics for Cloud-Native Systems
              </h4>
              <p>
                Around 2012, Prometheus was developed and subsequently given to
                the CNCF. It introduced the PromQL query language, a
                multi-dimensional data model (labels), and a pull-based metrics
                model. This made it feasible to gather and query
                high-cardinality metrics across massive fleets of services,
                significantly improving how engineers monitor services in
                environments like Kubernetes.

              <h4 class="subheading">Grafana: Unified Visualization</h4>
              <p>
                Soon after, Grafana emerged as a time-series data visualization
                layer. It developed into the "single glass pane" for
                observability over time, able to retrieve data from Tempo,
                Prometheus, Loki, and numerous other backends. Grafana
                transforms metrics, logs, and traces into visually
                comprehensible dashboards that facilitate real-time
                decision-making for you as a learner.
              </p>

              <h4 class="subheading">Loki: Rethinking Logs</h4>
              <p>
                Loki was released as a log aggregation system to go along with
                Prometheus. Loki mainly indexes labels (metadata) rather than
                entire log bodies, which can be costly. This method reduces the
                cost of log storage and improves query alignment with Prometheus
                metrics. In actuality, this implies that you can jump straight
                into the pertinent logs with the same labels from a high-level
                metric in a Grafana panel.

                OpenTelemetry: The Instrumentation Standard
              </h4>
              <p>
                By combining previous initiatives (OpenTracing and OpenCensus)
                into a single, vendor-neutral telemetry standard, OpenTelemetry
                (OTel) was created. For metrics, logs, and traces across
                numerous languages and frameworks, OTel establishes standardized
                APIs, SDKs, and semantic conventions. It significantly lowers
                vendor lock-in and redundant instrumentation work and acts as
                the glue between your instrumented application and backends like
                Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo.
              </p>

              <p>
                Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, Tempo, and OpenTelemetry collectively
                signify the transition from traditional monitoring to full-stack
                observability, providing you with the means to track problems
                throughout entire distributed systems and not just identify when
                something is broken.

              <h2>Discussion and Analysis</h2>

              <div class="callout callout-note">
                <p>
                  Everyone can agree that this open source stack—Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, and OTel—is sound technically. There is strong community support and no vendor lock-in because it is supported by the CNCF. Prometheus has essentially taken over as the benchmark for metrics, and with OTel, our instrumentation should endure over time. Therefore, this setup makes a lot of sense just in terms of architecture and technology.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The team has a minor disagreement about whether it is feasible for every business to operate. Some people adore the flexibility because we have complete control, everything is decoupled, and we can adjust each piece as we see fit.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It takes a lot of continuous effort to run separate systems for metrics, logs, and tracing.  You typically need skilled SREs committed to it in order to scale them, maintain high availability, and troubleshoot problems.  The initial cost savings of going open source can be easily offset by the work required to run and maintain all of this for smaller teams.  In those situations, even though it is more costly, a single, integrated vendor platform is frequently the more practical and straightforward choice.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The stack is technically sound overall, but whether it's the "right" decision really depends on whether the company has the personnel and infrastructure to run it effectively.
