          <h2>1. Grafana Overview</h2>

          <h3 class="tech-name-heading">Grafana 📊</h3>

          <h3 class="subheading">Overview - What it does</h3>

          <p>
            Grafana is the final layer in our observability stack—it's the universal
            visualization, analysis, and alerting platform. At its core, Grafana is
            an open-source web application designed to help you query, visualize, and
            understand your metrics, logs, and traces, no matter where they are stored.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike Prometheus or Loki, Grafana is data-source agnostic. It doesn't
            store data itself; instead, it acts as a powerful front-end, connecting to
            various back-end databases (like Prometheus, Loki, MySQL, ElasticSearch,
            and many others) and transforming their raw data into beautiful, actionable
            dashboards.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="subheading">The Visualization Layer</h3>
          <p>
            Grafana's main component is the dashboard, which is composed of several
            panels. A panel is a single visualization (a graph, a single stat, or a
            table) representing data fetched from one or more data sources. This allows
            engineers to consolidate all aspects of their system's health onto a single
            screen.
          </p>
          

          <hr/>

          <h3 class="subheading">History</h3>
          <p>
            Grafana was originally released in 2014 as a fork of Kibana 3, but was
            quickly re-architected to focus entirely on flexible time-series
            visualization. Its popularity exploded with the rise of the Prometheus and
            Kubernetes ecosystems, establishing itself as the de-facto standard for
            operational dashboards in cloud-native environments.

        <section id="s2" class="module-section">
          <h2>2. Data Sources</h2>

          <p>
            The first step in using Grafana is defining a Data Source. This is a
            connection configuration that tells Grafana how to reach and query your
            back-end storage systems.
          </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Connecting the Triad (Loki & Prometheus)</h3>

          <p>
            In our stack, the two most critical data sources are Prometheus (for
            metrics) and Loki (for logs).
          </p>
          
          <div class="callout callout-example">
            <h4>Prometheus Data Source Configuration</h4>
            <p>
              You simply tell Grafana the URL where your Prometheus server is running
              (e.g., <code>http://localhost:9090</code>) and set the data source name, typically
              Prometheus. Grafana then knows to use PromQL to query this source.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="callout callout-example">
            <h4>Loki Data Source Configuration</h4>
            <p>
              Similarly, you provide the URL for your Loki server (e.g.,
              <code>http://loki:3100</code>). Grafana uses the LogQL language to query this
              source, allowing you to filter and aggregate log lines.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            Grafana's ability to seamlessly switch between data sources within the same
            dashboard is what makes the
            Metrics-Logs-Traces (MLT) correlation possible, forming the basis of
            true observability.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Panels & Dashboards</h2>

          <p>
            A Dashboard is the container for all your visualizations, while a
            Panel is the specific visualization component.
          </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Panel Types</h3>
          <p>
            Grafana offers a wide array of visualization options, allowing you to choose
            the best format for the data you are presenting:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Graph (Time Series): The standard line graph for showing trends
              over time (e.g., CPU utilization, request rate).</li>
            <li>Stat (Single Value): Displays a large single number, often the
              latest value or an aggregate (e.g., current error count).</li>
            <li>Table: Excellent for showing detailed, labeled data or logs.</li>
            <li>Heatmap: Used for visualizing distributions over two dimensions,
              often latency over time.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="subheading">The Query Editor</h3>
          <p>
            Every panel has a Query Editor where you select the Data Source and write
            the query (e.g., PromQL or LogQL). Grafana provides auto-completion and a
            query builder to make this process easier.
          </p>

          <p class="term">
            Dashboard Best Practice: Always design dashboards for a specific
            audience or purpose. For example, a high-level "Executive Dashboard" should
            only show 5-7 key health metrics, while a "Debugging Dashboard" should
            contain highly detailed metrics and correlating logs.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="s4" class="module-section">
          <h2>4. Variables & Filters</h2>

          <p>
            Variables are one of the most powerful features in Grafana, enabling
            interactive, reusable, and dynamic dashboards.
          </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">What is a Variable?</h3>
          <p>
            A variable is a value that can be changed through a dropdown list at the top
            of the dashboard. When you change the variable's value, the query in every
            panel on that dashboard automatically updates to filter the results.
          </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Example: Instance Filtering</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of creating separate dashboards for every server (instance), you can
            use a variable called <code>$instance</code>.
          </p>
          <div class="callout callout-example">
            <p>
              <strong>PromQL Query using a Variable:</strong>
              <pre><code>http_requests_total{instance="$instance"}</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              The variable's values can be automatically populated by running a PromQL
              query against your Prometheus source (e.g., <code>label_values(up, instance)</code>).
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Variables transform a static dashboard into an interactive control panel,
            allowing users to dynamically filter by service, container, hostname, or
            user group.

          <h2>5. Building Observability Views</h2>

          <p>
            The goal of using Grafana with Prometheus and Loki is to establish clear
            links between your metrics, logs, and traces.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="subheading">The Logs & Metrics Connection</h3>
          <p>
            Grafana allows you to jump directly from a metric spike to the related logs
            at that exact time.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Process: You see a spike in a metric (e.g., request error rate) on a
              Graph panel.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drilldown: You click on the spike, and Grafana can be configured to
              open a linked panel or dashboard that automatically queries Loki using the
              same labels (like `service="web-api"`) for that time window.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <blockquote class="standout-opinion">
            Key Concept (MLT Correlation): A mature Grafana dashboard provides a unified view.
            It allows the user to identify an anomaly (Metrics), investigate the cause
            (Logs), and isolate the problematic code path (Traces), all without leaving
            the platform.

          <h2>6. Sharing & Organizing Dashboards</h2>
          <img
            src="Grafanareport.png"
            alt="Diagram showing the Prometheus server, its pull model scraping various exporters and targets, storing data in the TSDB, and integrating with Alertmanager and Grafana."
          />

          <p>
            The value of a dashboard is maximized when it is easily shareable and well-organized.
          </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Provisioning (Code-Based Management)</h3>
          <p>
            While you can create dashboards manually in the UI, modern practice dictates
            using Dashboard Provisioning. Dashboards are defined as JSON files
            and stored in your version control system (like Git). Grafana is configured
            to automatically load these files on startup, ensuring that dashboards are
            version-controlled and consistent across all environments.
          </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Folders and Permissions</h3>
          <p>
            Grafana uses Folders to logically group dashboards (e.g., "Team A Services,"
            "Infrastructure"). This is crucial for manageability and for applying
            Permissions to control which teams or users can view or edit specific
            sets of operational data.
